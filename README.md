# BLANCHE Landing Page Assessment Test
Static Webpage created using PHP, HTML, CSS, JS for assessment test

NodeJS - I made a simple server to run php files. I did this because I dont have apache.

 P.S. - For this assessment, I did not make this mobile responsive due to my tight schedule and a lot of interviews ongoing from other employers.

 Please resize your screen using inspect element > dimension, screen-width on 1500px
